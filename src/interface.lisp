(in-package :xarray)

;;;; General interface for objects accessible with xref (objects like
;;;; this are called xrefable).
;;;;
;;;; We distinguish two levels of the interface: the basic (element
;;;; access, dimension information) and the extended (type
;;;; information, creation of similar objects).


;;;; Basic interface
;;;;
;;;; Objects accessible with xref are array-like objects of
;;;;
;;;;    (xdims object)
;;;;
;;;; dimensions, where elements are indexed with
;;;;
;;;;    (xrank object)
;;;;
;;;; subscripts, each ranging from
;;;;
;;;;    (list 0 (1- (nth dimension (xdims object)))) 
;;;;
;;;; inclusive.  Not all elements need to be setable, if
;;;; they are not, trying to call
;;;;
;;;;    (setf xref)
;;;;
;;;; on that element will signal a condition.
;;;;
;;;; Objects can have a particular type imposed on elements, which can
;;;; be checked by looking at the contents of 
;;;;
;;;;    (xtype object <ref>)
;;;;
;;;; and finally
;;;;
;;;;    (xref object <ref>)
;;;;
;;;; will access the particular structure needed.  Elements returned
;;;; by xref are guaranteed to be a subtype of this type, and for
;;;;
;;;;    (setf (xref object <ref>) <new object>)
;;;;
;;;; we have that <new object> must consist of elements that are an
;;;; appropriate subtype.
;;;; 
;;;; Conditions for the wrong number of subscripts, subscripts being
;;;; out of bounds, or writing non-writable elements or elements with
;;;; incorrect type are available. (!!! see notes there)

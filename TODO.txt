Suggestions for Tamas:

* Change 'xtype' method to allow for an optional array index?

  i.e. (* * *) or (1 * *) which would allow for extraction of a
  restricted-type subarray (for example if the basic structure is a
  subarray.

  This could probably be implemented via xtype on a view of a subset,
  rather than a second interface generic.  Since we might have an
  xrefable object which is not array like but has an array-like
  indexing mechanism.

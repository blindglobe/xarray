title: Implement an equalp for xref-able objects
desc: |-
  We need to implement an equality function for xref-able objects.  Currently, one can TAKE an xrefable object
  or two and compare the taken structures as equalp arrays, but it would be great to do this via xref access
  using xrank/xdims to compare structure equality, and xref to compare element equality (if so).
